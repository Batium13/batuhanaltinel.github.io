## `Who am I ?`

Hello, my name is Batuhan ALTINEL. I was born in 1992 in Kırklareli. I studied high school in Luleburgaz Anatolian High School. I graduated from Süleyman Demirel University, Department of Mechanical Engineering.

I worked as a mechanical engineer in two different companies for about 2 years. I worked in the mold and heavy steel industries, in design and manufacturing engineering positions. I wanted to step into the game development industry, which I wanted to work on for a long time. Since I couldn't find enough time and energy, I had to make a choice and I left my current job in June 2022, listening to the voice inside me.

I'm currently trying to develop games on the Unity3D game engine. There is no limit to learning and development. I want to continue my career in the game development industry and I am working on it.
